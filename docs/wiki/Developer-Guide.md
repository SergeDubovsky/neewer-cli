# Developer Guide

The full maintainer guide is kept in the source repo:

- [docs/developer-guide.md](https://github.com/SergeDubovsky/neewer-cli/blob/main/docs/developer-guide.md)

This page exists so wiki users can quickly find implementation details, protocol notes, and release workflow documentation.
